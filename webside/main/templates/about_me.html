    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a gamer who recently started my journey into Python coding. My primary interest lies in cybersecurity, particularly red teaming. I believe that to excel in blue team defense, one must understand offensive strategies. My motto is: "Nothing is safe; it's just a matter of time before someone gets in."</p>
